==========

Some popular recursive functions written in Ruby:

* `range(first, last)` - takes two integers and returns an array of all numbers between them
* `sum(nums)` - takes an array of digits and sums all of the elements
* `exp(base, power)` - calculates an exponential number
* `deep_dup` - performs a dup of all interior arrays/elements of an array
* `fibs(n)` - returns the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
* `bsearch(nums, target)` - recursive [binary search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
* `merge_sort(array)` - recursive [merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* `subsets(array)` - return all the subsets of an array
* `make_change(amount, coins = [25, 10 ,5, 1])` - returns an array of the smallest number of coins that will total the amount
